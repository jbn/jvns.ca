### High Reliability Infrastructure Migrations (keynote, KubeCon NA 2018)

[slides](https://speakerdeck.com/jvns/high-reliability-infrastructure-migrations)

**Abstract**:  For companies with high availability requirements (99.99% uptime or higher), running
new software in production comes with a lot of risks. But it's possible to make significant
infrastructure changes while maintaining the availability your customers expect!I'll give you a
toolbox for derisking migrations and making infrastructure changes with confidence, with examples
from our Kubernetes & Envoy experience at Stripe.

## Systems programming as a swiss army knife (PyCon 2015)

**Abstract**: You might think of the Linux kernel as something that only kernel developers need to know about. Not so! It turns out that understanding some basics about kernels and systems programming makes you a better developer, and you can use this knowledge when debugging your normal everyday Python programs.

<strong>
[Strange Loop](http://thestrangeloop.com), September 2014

**Abstract**: Writing operating systems sounds like it's only for wizards, but
it turns out that operating systems are written by humans like you and me. I'm

about a few concrete ways to get started with kernel hacking, ranging from the
super-easy to the terrifyingly difficult.
