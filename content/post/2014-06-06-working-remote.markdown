title: Working remote, 3 months in
url: /blog/2014/06/06/working-remote/

I've been working remotely for [Stripe](http://stripe.com) for 3
months now. 

I decided to do this because I interviewed at this place, and the
people were thoughtful and friendly and interesting and knew things
that I did not know! But they were all in San Francisco, and I didn't
want to move there at all. They convinced me that if I worked remote
it might not be a disaster.

I was still pretty scared about working remote, though! So far it's
been hard, but I'm learning how to do it better. I'm somewhat
extroverted, so it's possible for me to go a bit stir-crazy sitting
alone by myself all day.

I live on the east coast. The people I work with are mostly in San
Francisco, three time zones away. So when I start work it's usually
around 6am in SF.

Let's start with some things I have trouble with:

### Hard things

* Timezones are hard. If I start working at 8, there aren't many
  people I can talk to BECAUSE IT'S 5AM. (however: it's a really good
  time to focus! And I can be a wizard and finish tasks before
  everyone wakes up in the morning!)
* I don't know how to meet new people without visiting the physical
  office. A lot of people are just names on IRC to me. I do not know
  of any upside to this, or how to fix it.
* I'm worried about the winter.
* I didn't realize how much I depended on synchronous communication
  (talking face-to-face!) to do things until it was taken away from
  me. This is thankfully getting easier.
* It seems pretty difficult for me to know very much about the office
  culture.
* I find building consensus about technical decisions hard to do
  remotely. (see: depending on synchronous communication)
* A/V is hard. I often don't try to participate in talks because I
  don't expect the experience to be good.

### Good things:

* I get to work with people who I like and live where I want to live.
  And I'm learning a lot. This is why I decided to do this in the
  first place =)
* I can work in my backyard in the sun.
* I have more flexibility about when and where to work. I appreciate
  this more than I thought I would.
* Thinking about working remote as "a cool possibility with some ups
  and downs" instead of "this enemy that means I HAVE TO SEE LESS
  PEOPLE OH NO" helps me be happy instead of grumpy.
* My happiness seems to be proportional to the amount of time I spend
  talking to people. This is something I can measure and optimize!
* I'm getting better at asynchronous communication.
* If I ask someone to do something when I finish work, they'll be
  working for 3 hours after me! It might be already done when I start
  the next day.
* 2 people on my team are remote!
  ([colin](https://twitter.com/colinmarc) and
  [avi](https://twitter.com/avibryant)). This is a huge deal. If I
  were the only one it would probably be a disaster and I would be way
  more sad. As far as I can tell Avi's been working remote
  approximately forever and he has a lot of good things to say.
* I like that Stripe actually changes things to accommodate remotes
  (for instance: the all-hands meeting switched times so that it's not
  at 7:30pm on Friday on the east coast)
* Basically all of the discussion on my team happens over IRC/email.
  This means that there is a lot of IRC to keep up with. This is
  harder than I expected.

### Strategies

* I changed my work computer's clock to be the time in San Francisco.
  This helps more than I expected.
* I made a short URL (http://go/julia) that links to a Google Hangout
  with me
* Deciding to be happy this summer. There is no reason to be sad in
  the summer.
* Talking to other people who work remote sometimes and learning about
  things they do!

That's all! Maybe there will be further updates.
