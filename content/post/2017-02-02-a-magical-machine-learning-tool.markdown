Today I learned about a really cool machine learning art tool!!

It is called "paintschainer" and it lets you colour in black and white
images! 

The github repo is at
[https://github.com/pfnet/PaintsChainer](https://github.com/pfnet/PaintsChainer)
and you can try it out yourself at
[http://paintschainer.preferred.tech/](http://paintschainer.preferred.tech/). It seems to be by [this Japanese company](https://www.preferred-networks.jp/ja/).

Here is my favorite thing I used it for so far: (before & after). This is a
picture of me from the networking zine cover that [liz](https://twitter.com/_lbaillie) drew.

I also coloured in the whole cover of the networking zine as an experiment.
It also made me happy but didn't come out quite as awesome. Someone on twitter [described](https://twitter.com/nabijaczleweli/status/827301893252734976) this as "Confused Girl In Orange Hoodie
Finds LSD, Hallucinates Purple Cat, Becomes Networking Genius" which I
think is probably about right.

### machine learning art tools & making something that feels like I made it

This made me think about what kinds of machine learning art tools I find
compelling / exciting. I am not very good at a lot of technical art
things yet -- I can't do shading, I don't really know how to colour
something in. I can't draw a cartoon animal without following a
tutorial.

**[deepart.io](https://deepart.io/)** lets you take a photo and redraw it
in the "style" of another painting. I thought [this example](https://deepart.io/img/OhtbfXRb/) was really cool. It takes a
pretty ordinary photograph, combines it with a painting, and gives you
something really cool looking!

I spent a bunch of time playing with deepart.io but couldn't make
anything I really was excited about. My current hypothesis is -- I want to use magical art
tools to make things that feel like **I** made them.

### tablets & tracing

While we're talking about art tools and technology that enables you to
do something cool -- I
bought a 10 inch Android tablet in September, which is what I use to
draw all my zines / programming drawings. Another fun thing I very
occasionally do with it is to take photos and then trace them into sketches.

This one is a house a few blocks away from where I live.

<div align="center">
<img src="/images/stairs.png" width=300px>
</div>

This is dramatically better than my usual house drawing skills. Here is
what it usually looks like when I draw a house freehand:

<div align="center">
<img src="/images/terrible-house.png" width=200px>
</div>

I wondered what this would look if I coloured it with the magical
colouring tool paintschainer. It's kind of cool!

<div align="center">
<img src="/images/stairs_coloured.jpg" width=400px>
</div>

I find this really cool because I can make an image with my hands (I
drew all the lines in that image!) with a lot less skills than I would
have needed without this magical technology. And it feel more like a
thing that _I_ made because I have a lot of creative control over what
it looks like (I took the original photo, I decided what to trace, and I
picked the colours to colour it in with).

### a very short listing of magical art tools

* a tablet that you can use to trace photos with
* [deepart.io](https://deepart.io) (and this paper: [a neural algorithm of artistic style](https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.06576). [github repo](https://github.com/jcjohnson/neural-style))
* [deep dream generator](https://deepdreamgenerator.com/) ("add dogs & creepy eyes to anything!")
* [paintschainer](http://paintschainer.preferred.tech) (what I used for
  the images in this post). [github repo](https://github.com/pfnet/PaintsChainer)
* This cool ["realistic image manipulation"](http://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~junyanz/projects/gvm/) paper has some nice videos (but you don't appear to be able to use it). Thanks to Katherine Ye for showing it to me!!

if you know about more tools like this I would like to hear about them!
This kind of thing is probably the application of neural networks that
makes me the most excited.
