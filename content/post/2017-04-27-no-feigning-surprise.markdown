I posted this drawing on Twitter a while back, and wanted to put it here
too because I think it's an important idea. "No feigning surprise" is
probably the social rule from the [Recurse Center Manual](https://www.recurse.com/manual#sec-environment) that's had the
biggest impact on me over the years. Here's the quote from the manual:

> ... you shouldn't act surprised when people say they don't know
> something. This applies to both technical things ("What?! I can't
> believe you don't know what the stack is!") and non-technical things
> ("You don't know who RMS is?!"). Feigning surprise has absolutely no

A key trick here is to not act surprised **even if you're actually
surprised**. (because whether you're performing surprise or just
genuinely a bit surprised, it has the same negative effect!) I've gotten
better at not acting surprised over the years when somebody doesn't know
something that I expected them to know, and I'm happy to have practiced
it.

And I can sometimes transmute surprise into excitement, like "what's the
stack?" "oh it's really interesting let me tell you about it!!"

Like a while back my cousin was like "the internet travels in cables
under the ocean? are you serious?" and I got to tell her YES COOL RIGHT
and talk about how internet packets go across the ocean!
(like this video of a [shark attacking an undersea cable](https://www.wired.com/2014/08/shark_cable/)).

Also I'm less likely to be embarrassed these days when someone is
suprised that I don't know something. I asked someone recently what
a PCI bus was and they asked "are you serious??" and I said
"yes!!" And I maybe secretly thought that person was being a bit rude
but they totally explained what a PCI bus was to me so I wasn't that mad
=)

Anyway, here's the drawing.

There's also a nice xkcd with basically the
same message: [Ten Thousand](https://xkcd.com/1053/).
