I often want to know how much memory my processes are using. When I run
`top`, I see this:

For years I've been reading explanations of the VIRT, RSS, and SHARED
columns and for years I've been like "ugh, why is this so complicated,
why can't I just know how much memory my process is using, this is
silly.

Today I read the super-helpful article [htop explained](https://peteris.rocks/blog/htop/#virt-vsz-virtual-image),
and together with learning a little bit more about how virtual memory
works on Linux, I think I understand what's going on!

The short version is "the way memory works on Linux is just
fundamentally more complicated than 'process Y is using memory X, so
asking 'how much memory is my process using' can only ever have
approximate answers'

For all this to make sense, first we need to understand how virtual
memory works and we're going to learn what a "page table" is.

### virtual memory & the page table

You have RAM in your computer (i have touched mine with my hands!). That
RAM has addresses, and data lives at addresses in RAM.

When you access memory in your program (like "0x39242345"), those
addresses are not physical RAM addresses. They're "virtual" memory
addresses, that are specific to your process. I wrote a comic about how
this works:

<div align="center">
<a href="https://drawings.jvns.ca/drawings/pagetable.svg">
<img src="https://drawings.jvns.ca/drawings/pagetable.png">
</a>
</div>

Here's a text version of that comic:

* every process has its own memory space (so `0x39242000` might point to
  "dog" in one process and "cat" in another process)
* The virtual memory addresses like `0x39242000` map to physical RAM
  addresses, and diferent processes have different mappings
* The mapping of virtual -> physical addresses is different for each
  process! The mapping is generally done one 4 kilobyte block at a time
* The virtual -> physical addresses map is called the **page table**

I'd heard about the page table before, but one thing that was really
confusing to me until yesterday was -- how do these lookups of virtual
addresses happen, exactly? Wouldn't doing a lookup in a table every
single time you access memory be really slow?

The answer is that your CPU itself does the lookups in the page table!
It knows which part of physical RAM the mapping for your process lives
in, and then every time it executes an instruction that accesses memory,
it looks up which real physical memory it needs for that instruction in
RAM.

When you switch processes, the kernel updates the address of the page
table so that the CPU knows where to look.

### side note: page tables & caches

You might be thinking "wow, does that mean that every time I do a memory
access I actually have to do **two** memory accesses"? And you would be
right! It *is* kind of expensive to do that.

Your CPU helps make this faster by caching page table lookups in the
[translation lookaside buffer (TLB)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Translation_lookaside_buffer).
This is a super fast cache and if your virtual memory address is in the
TLB then you just need to do 1 memory access to access memory instead
of 2.

I think if you access your memory in a predictable way (like access a
bunch of memory all at once, your CPU can do smart optimizations like
"huh, I'm going to need to look up that address in the page table next,
I will preload it into the TLB").  This is because modern CPUs are not
actually linear things, but do all kinds of operations at the same time.

At this point we're deeper in hardware optimizations than we need to be
for the purposes for this blog post, and besides I've already probably
said something wrong about how hardware works, so let's go back to
discussing how much memory our processes are using :).

### shared memory

Now that we understand how memory accesses work on Linux, we can talk
about the first complicated thing: **shared memory**. Here is a comic
about copy on write.

<div align="center">
<a href="https://drawings.jvns.ca/drawings/copyonwrite.svg">
<img src="https://drawings.jvns.ca/drawings/copyonwrite.png">
</a>
</div>

So, this is weird! This means that 2 processes can be using **exactly
the same physical memory**. And worse, that shared memory could be
scattered in totally random places through the process (so you could
have 4MB of non-shared memory, then 8MB of shared memory, then more
unshared memory, etc.)

There's no clean way to logically split up shared and non-shared memory.
Basically any 4 kilobyte page could be shared or not shared. This is
great for performance (less copying!) and reducing memory usage, but
makes it hard.

So I could be running 16 Google Chrome processes, and you could have

* some memory that all of them share (C libraries)
* some memory that only a few of them share
* some memory that is shared for a while, and then slowly becomes
  unshared over time

You could imagine counting every single page of memory, saying "okay,
that page is shared by 6 processes, I will divide it by 6 and
attribute that amount to my process". This seems like a resaonable way
to count memory to me. It turns out that you can actually do this
somewhow via `/proc/$PID/smaps` and the PSS column but I have not
investigated this yet and it is not how `top` reports memory use.

### swap and mmap

The next (and, I think, last) reason counting memory is complicated is
that not all virtual memory actually maps to physical memory.

You might have heard of swap!!

In your page table, instead of a virtual memory address being mapped to
a physical address, you can map it to "EMERGENCY ASK THE OPERATING
SYSTEM FOR HELP". (basically null or something). When the CPU comes across this, it'll be like "what
the hell is this, operating system, please fix it". (the technical term
is a "page fault")

At this point the operating system could in principle do whatever it wants, but usually
the reason this is happening is that that virtual memory address is
**actually some data on disk**. So the operating system will go read the
data from disk, put it into physical memory, and then the CPU will go
merrily on its way and keep running your code.

There are two normal reasons you might have memory addresses that
actually map to the disk:

* **swap**: your operating system actually ran out of physical memory so
  it put a bunch of data from RAM on disk
* a program asked your operating system to do it with **mmap**.
  Basically if you want to read a 1GB file, you can say "hey, please map
  this file into memory, and just load it lazily when i access that
  memory". This can have better performance than reading the file
  normally, and it's a very common pattern.


### how much memory is my program using?

Okay, we know know about a bajillion things about how memory works on
Linux now! Let's go back to what we saw in top.

<img src="/images/memory_usage.png">

**"VIRT"** means "this is how much virtual address space this program has".
This could be mmaped files, and all kinds of stuff that does not
actually live in physical memory at all. This number is not really that
useful if you want to know how much RAM you're using. 

**RSS** (resident set size) is much closer to your normal notion of "how much memory I am
using" -- it's the amount of actual physical RAM that is used by that
process in some way. For example, in the table above `compiz` is using
1.6GB of virtual memory but only 270MB of actual real RAM.

**SHR** is the amount of physical RAM for that process that is shared
with other processes. I think you have no way of knowing how many other
programs that RAM is shared with, or if it's likely to continue being
shared in the future (like if it's copy-on-write shared memory). We can
see that half of Google Chrome's memory is shared with other 
processes (probably other Chrome processes).

**%MEM** is the percentage of physical RAM that the process is using. so
it's RSS divided by total physical memory.

### i feel way better

I've been confused about this for years so it feels nice to
actually understand what these numbers mean and why there are so many of
them and why it's so confusing. It turns out that virtual memory systems
are kinda complicated, but that if I understand the basics it helps to
clear up a lot of confusion! Awesome.
