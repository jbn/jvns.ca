title: What women in technology really think (150 of them, at least)

spoiler: EVERYONE IS DIFFERENT AND PEOPLE THINK LOTS OF DIFFERENT
THINGS

I've read tons of articles about or by women who work as developers. I
read a thing yesterday and it was the best thing I've ever read.
Yesterday I found a link to [a survey on Twitter](http://t.co/mgWCfII0Kn)
asking for the experiences of women who work in technology, and did the
survey. There's question at the end that asks 

**Any other comments you'd like to make?**

I didn't think much of it at the time -- I said something (that I've had
an incredibly good experience, but that it makes me very angry that
other people have bad experiences). But then I looked at *everyone
else's responses*. It's an amazing example of a wide range of women's
opinions and experiences, and I think you should read it. I've formatted
[all of the responses to that question](https://gist.github.com/jvns/38c1c7572ce200a50227) a little
better, or you can see 
[the full survey results](https://docs.google.com/a/stripe.com/forms/d/1TGGWz-BxClDC2LEpfon4Aib3Ac0kmnRtjLFLvIrrJc8/viewanalytics?usp=form_confirm).

There are lots of negative comments, from women who are harassed or
disrespected at work. We have a lot of work to do. But there are also a
ton of very positive comments, from women who have supportive colleagues
and mentors and enjoy their work and who feel respected.

I also loved the answers to **What do (or did) you like best about
working in tech?**: the two most popular answers were *"I enjoy the
actual work"* and *"I like solving problems that are really difficult"*.
(about 75% of people). ME TOO THAT'S HOW I FEEL <3

Here are a few excerpts that I found particularly interesting: (though
basically every response is interesting, and I think you should read
them all.)

> I feel that being female and over 40 has made my career feel much more
> tenuous. I worry that if I lost my job I wouldn't be able to be hired
> again in my field.

> I personally have not had many issues arise due to gender, but I feel
> this is largely because I tend to behave in a very male way by natural
> inclination. I tend not to notice or be disturbed by behaviour many
> women find inappropriate or intimidating. I don't think it's rare or
> acceptable, just not something I feel worried about for myself. It
> does frustrate me a lot to see other women experience it though.

> For years I could say I had never felt or been held back in tech
> because of my gender. That is no longer the case. 

> I feel like I've had things pretty easy, in part because I often get
> along as "one of the guys."

> Currently very very happy in a great, friendly and supportive
> environment (being female, a mother, and part-time hasn't stopped me
> getting promoted) - so they do exist!

>  I have a *great* working environment. [...] Interestingly, we do have
>  one engineer in particular who can be loud and overbearing and could,
>  if given enough power, make the environment somewhat hostile -- but
>  that's exactly why no one gives him that power. 

> I've experienced as much discrimination from female groups as I have
> from male-dominated organizations.

> As of this past September, I've been 40 years in tech. It distresses
> me that: 1. the situation of women in tech has gotten worse, but 2: a
> lot of the women younger than I are behaving as if the problems
> they're facing are new ones, and don't look to the past to see what
> works/doesn't work, thereby losing traction by repeating some of our
> (the older women's) mistakes!

> I have been electrical engineer 31 years. Still feeling odd to be only
> woman among colleagues

> I feel more comfortable in a mostly-male environment. Probably because
> that's how it was in my family, I had no sisters, but 3 brothers; and
> my relationship with my mother wasn't as great.

> I have no idea how much my male colleagues make. How are we supposed
> to find that out?

> I love this industry and I doubt I'll ever leave it, but it has a long
> way to go in order for it to grow up.

> While I definitely recognize that this is some (maybe even a lot of)
> womens' experience, I felt somewhat misled when directed here from
> Twitter to take a survey about "women in tech." Would love a survey
> sometime to focus on us and all the cool stuff what we're actually
> doing, rather than continuing to focus on aspects of tech that are
> primary brought on by men.

> i feel like my employer might look the same as a really bad one based
> on the checkmarks but it is actually an overwhelmingly supportive env
> and any inappropriate situations are dealt with very well. that they
> come up in the first place is an industry wide issue - what
> differentiates companies is how they handle it.

> I feel extremely fortunate to had a very kind, feminist man as my
> ph.d. supervisor. He made sure that myself and other aspiring women
> scientists were able to attend professional development seminars that
> were specifically aimed at helping women overcome gender-related
> discrimination in our field. I hope that in my future career I can pay
> it forward and help younger women advance their careers.

> Ageism hits women harder than it does men.

> There's definitely "bro-culture" at work. If you're not one of the
> bros, forget about going to lunch with upper management, getting that
> raise, or getting the best projects. A female coworker of mine was
> told to "just sit and look pretty" at a meeting once. 

> I'm very lucky that I work at a company that highly values equality
> and works to make sure our environment is a healthy one for everyone,
> with options for professional development and more. 

> I think I've been quite fortunate in that I've worked at companies
> that encourage and support women in tech. There have been individual
> male colleagues who have at times made work life difficult but I
> always felt like the company had my back. These individuals were
> spoken to by their managers and the issues were resolved.

> Where's the option to say I feel great, valued, treated equally,
> competent and successful?

> Over the years, it was so subtle, but while men were promoted, I was
> sidelined and told I didn't need additional leadership training. I
> watched peers go to new heights while I perfected and elevated my
> current role, but was never able to move beyond it because I was
> perceived as indispensable in that role, but it also locked me in away
> from management opportunities.

> Aside from my boss, the people at work are great and supportive. I
> just feel like I am not good enough of a programmer and I'm bringing
> down the view of "women in tech." I know that's ridiculous and maybe
> it's partially that it's a bad job with work that I have a bitch of a
> time being excited about. [...] But the thing is, I genuinely enjoy
> programming for myself, and enjoy the culture (aside from the nasty
> stuff!) so I can't see myself ever leaving that. 

> Overall I've had an overwhelmingly positive experience as a woman in
> tech, and consider myself quite fortunate in that respect. I'm working
> in healthcare IT now, which has a great gender ratio and excellent
> people and meaningful work.

> The tech industry is a great place to be and one day women will feel
> just as welcome as men to be in it. I hope I'll get to see that day
> myself.

> I realized recently that feeling "lucky" because I've only been
> sexually harassed by an executive once and denied access to a job once
> (that I know of) is insane. It might be getting off easy, but a guy
> would have sued. I would leave tech if I had any other skillset. I'm
> over the frat boy air hockey culture.

> I genuinely had trouble thinking of women in tech I admired (aside
> from the two bosses I've had in the last 4 years, who are brilliant).
> I also got quite bummed out when I got to the question about my
> experiences and realised exactly how many boxes I could tick.

> It wasn't an option, but I have considered declining a perk at work,
> because I was afraid people would think it was a reward for a sexual
> favor. I'm always worried that people will think I get ahead, not
> because my work is great (it is!), but because I use sex in some way. 

> I'm so tired of being the only technical woman in the room. I'm tired
> of being the only woman in the room and having it assumed that someone
> brought their admin. I'm tired of people talking to my husband (also a

> I'm tired of people asking when I'm going to leave the field as if
> it's a given. I'm afraid that it is a given.

These answers give me hope and also break my heart. I hope we can all
make our own organizations better, and make everyone feel more like 

> "I feel great, valued, treated equally, competent and successful?" 

and less like 

> "I'm tired of people asking when I'm going to leave the field as if
> it's a given. I'm afraid that it is a given.".
