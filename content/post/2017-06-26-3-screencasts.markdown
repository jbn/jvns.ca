On Sunday I was thinking about how I like giving short talks, but travelling to
give talks is so much work. What if I could give talks from my house?

So I recorded 3 2-minute screencasts (nothing fancy, 1 take, no editing)
showing demos of /proc, strace, and tcpdump. Here they are!

These were surprisingly easy to do and some people seemed to like them so maybe
I'll do more. Who knows!

### stracing python's asyncio library
