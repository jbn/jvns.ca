This week I read a paper called [A Critique of the CAP Theorem](https://arxiv.org/abs/1509.05393) by 
[Martin Kleppmann](https://martin.kleppmann.com/). I thought it was
super interesting and I wanted to tell you why! And maybe convince you
to read it.

The CAP theorem is a often-cited result in distributed systems research.
It basically says that, if you have a real-world database that runs on
more than one computer, it can either offer

* **linearizability** (which I won't explain here, but is a specific
  consistency requirement. There's a pretty good explanation [in this blog post](https://martin.kleppmann.com/2015/05/11/please-stop-calling-databases-cp-or-ap.html))
* or **availability** (every computer in the system can always give you a
  response)

This theorem is sometimes phrased as "consistency, availability, or partition
tolerance, pick 2", but we've established pretty well at this point that
[you can't sacrifice partition tolerance](https://codahale.com/you-cant-sacrifice-partition-tolerance/),
so you just get to pick between C and A. If you want more examples of
network partitions, there's this [very long list by Kyle Kingsbury of examples of network partitions happening and having serious consequences](https://github.com/aphyr/partitions-post).

As usual i'm not a distributed systems expert and probably something in
this post is wrong.

### is the CAP theorem actually useful?

Some distributed systems claim to be linearizable, like Consul and etcd
and zookeeper. These use algorithms like Paxos or Raft. The CAP theorem
is a little bit useful for reasoning about these systems -- because
they're linearizable, they must not be totally available. You should
expect some downtime from those systems in practice. Good! That was
useful. Thanks, CAP theorem!

I have some extremely small amount of experience working with
linearizable systems, and in my experience those systems are actually
not always available! So this theorem also actually really does match up
with what happens in real life, which is cool.

Okay, but what about every other distributed system? For example! What
if I'm using a database system that has a primary and replicates writes
to a secondary, and then I read from the secondary sometimes?

This system is not linearizable. So the CAP theorem has... uh... nothing
to say about this system. But replicated database setups are extremely
common and extremely useful! It seems silly to just stop at "well,
that's not linearizable, I have nothing else to say". "AP" is not a
very useful description for this system since it has some interesting
consistency properties, and is quite different from some other "AP"
systems.

### the proof of the CAP theorem is extremely simple

I thought that the CAP theorem was like this complicated deep result in
distributed systems theory.

It turns out that (even though it is a somewhat useful thing!) it is a
really simple result to prove. Basically:

* you have 2 computers
* suppose those two computers can't communicate
* suppose furthermore that you want them to act consistently (if you
  write "hello" to Computer 1, you want the whole system to know the
  value is "hello")

Now suppose you ALSO want the system to be available. This is
impossible! Computer 2 can't tell you that the current value is "hello"!
There is no possible way it could know that because it can't communicate
with Computer 1!

That's basically the whole proof. You need to formalize it a bit by defining things clearly which is why the paper is several pages instead of 2 paragraphs. (definitions are important)! But the core idea is just not complicated.
For more, see [this illustrated guide](http://mwhittaker.github.io/2014/08/16/illustrated-proof-cap-theorem/)
and [the original paper](http://www.glassbeam.com/sites/all/themes/glassbeam/images/blog/10.1.1.67.6951.pdf), but the proof is not fundamentally more complicated than that.

To me this undermines the theorem a little bit -- CAP is a useful
shorthand for a useful idea, but it's not realy that profound. By
contrast, the [FLP impossibility theorem](http://the-paper-trail.org/blog/a-brief-tour-of-flp-impossibility/)
shows that is it impossible to build a distributed consensus algorithm
that will always terminate. (so there's some risk that an algorithm like
Paxos/Raft will get stuck in an infinite loop). This seems a lot less
obvious (and was an open question for a long time).

### is there a general tradeoff between consistency and availability?

So, once we've learned about the CAP theorem, we might hope that in
addition to the specific rule (if you're linearizable, you can't be
available), there might also be some more general tradeoff (if you're a
little bit more consistent, then you get a little bit less available).

This feels like a totally reasonable thing to hope. The CAP theorem does
not actually **say** anything about this hope, but maybe it's true
anyway!

## What happens when your network gets slow?

My favorite thing about this critique of the CAP theorem is it PROPOSES
A USEFUL ALTERNATIVE THEOREM. (the "How operation latency depends on
network delay" section of the paper)

Let's suppose your network gets SLOW. (Kleppmann defines this a little
more formally but I'm gonna go with SLOW)

Well!! If you're using a linearizable system, it means that your reads
are slow, and your writes are slow. That sucks!

What if you trade off and have a system which is a liiitle less
consistent? It turns out that if you want "sequential consistency", you
can have slow writes, but fast reads! That sounds a little like our
replicated database situation, maybe! (you could imagine that writing to
the primary could get slow).

Here is a table from the paper where he tabulates different consistency
levels and how fast of reads/writes you can get under adverse network
conditions.

<style type="text/css">
th {
    background-color: #4CAF50;
    color: white;
}

td {
padding: 2px 5px ;
}

table {
margin-bottom: 10px;
}
</style>

| consistency level      | write | read |
|------------------------|-------|------|
| linearizable           | slow  | slow |
| sequential consistency | slow  | fast |
| causal consistency     | fast  | fast |


In particular this means that if your network is totally down, then
writes in a linearizable system take an infinite amount of time (so
writing is actually impossible).

### why this is awesome

I think this different framing (where we talk about availability in
terms of network latency & speed of operations) is really cool, because:

* it actually relates better to my real life (sometimes my network is
  not totally down, but communication is SLOW! I would love my
  distributed systems theory to explain what will happen!)
* it lets me describe more systems! I feel almost motivated to
  learn what "sequential consistency"  and "causal consistency" even
  mean now to see if any of the systems I actually use match that
  definition.

The last kind of silly reason I think this is awesome is -- I spent a
really long time feeling bad that I didn't understand the CAP theorem or
know how to apply it.
It turns out that the CAP theorem is actually a relatively small theorem
which is only useful in a limited number of cases! So it was less that I
didn't understand it and more that it's actually just not thaaaaaaat
useful. Now I don't feel as bad! And I have some slightly better tools
for thinking about distributed systems! Yay.
