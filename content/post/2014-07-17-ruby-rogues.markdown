If you listen to the
[Ruby Rogues podcast](http://rubyrogues.com/165-rr-systems-programming-tricks-with-julia-evans/)
this week, you will find me! We talked about using systems programming
tools (like strace) to debug your regular pedestrian code, building an
operating system in Rust, but also other things I didn't expect, like
how asking stupid questions is an amazing way to learn.

Ruby Rogues also has a transcript of the entire episode, an index, and
links to everything anyone referenced during the episode, including
apparently 13 posts from this blog (!). I don't even understand how
this is possible, but apparently it is! It was a fun time, and
apparently it is totally okay to spend a Ruby podcast discussing Rust,
statistics, strace, and, well... not Ruby :)
