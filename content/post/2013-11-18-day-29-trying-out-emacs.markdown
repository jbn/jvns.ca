title: 'Day 29: Trying out Emacs!'

At Hacker School I've been watching all the Lisp wizards with their
emacs attached to magical running Lisp processes where they can change
and reload the code in real time. And I am officially jealous.

So I am trying out emacs! Tomorrow I will write Clojure and
use [Overtone](http://overtone.github.io/) to generate music and it
will be wonderful.

And there was a fantastic talk today by [Will Byrd](http://webyrd.net/)
about logic & relational programming where he showed how to
automatically generate quines and it was mindblowing and fun. So I
think I'm going to end up playing with Clojure's core.logic a bit,
because fun.

Definitely using evil mode, though, because I haven't spent years
practicing vim keybindings for nothing =).
