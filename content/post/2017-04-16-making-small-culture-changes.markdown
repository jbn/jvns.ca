A lot of the time we say that "culture comes from the top" and talk about the
responsibility of CEOs / executives / managers to set the culture. I think this
is super true, but I am not a CEO or manager or anything. I work as a software
engineer.

It's also true though that individual software engineers have some power! So I
want to talk about a few positive experiences me and my partner have had making
tiny changes at work! It turns out I've mostly worked on interviewing /
recruiting in engineering.

Here are a few examples of things my partner and I have tried to make a little
different at our jobs over the years.

### fairer interviews

When I started doing phone interviews (a few years ago now), I wasn't given any
clear standards to evaluate the people I was interviewing. And I didn't feel
like I was doing as good of job as I should be, so I asked some friends for
advice! One of my amazing friends suggested that I write down a rubric (a set
of clear guidelines to determine whether the candidate passed the interview or
not) for myself to use. So I did! I found some other rubrics we were using
internally, and wrote "Julia's phone screen rubric". I put it in a public
document and said other people could use it if they wanted too.

Eventually some colleagues gave me some suggestions about things to add to my
rubric, a few people started using it for themselves, and I made some changes.
Then one day people decided to standardize how we evaluated phone screens, it
got adopted as the standards everyone in engineering was going to use to
evaluate phone screens, and a few more changes were made to make it even
better. 

It turns out that having consistent standards is really cool! There are a ton
of different possible things to care about in interviews (do they test their
code? How are their debugging skills? Do they write ‘idiomatic' code? how
charismatic is the person?). Having a clear rubric helps make sure that.

I definitely didn't change this by myself (in particular, somebody else made
the decision that all interviewers should use consistent standards, and many
many other people contributed) but I think I helped a little bit and that made
me happy!

Also I think this is an interesting example of how the best way to make change
changes over time -- like, today if I wanted to change our interview rubrics I
probably wouldn't just announce "hey, I'm changing how I do it!" because we
have an existing process and I think it's important to respect that. But back
then I think that was a totally fine thing to do, because there wasn't a
consistent standard anyway so introducing a new standard didn't cause any
conflict.

### building postmortem culture

My partner [Kamal](https://kamalmarhubi.com/blog/) started at an (awesome) new job recently, that he really likes.
They're still relatively small, and hadn't built a habit of regularly writing
postmortems for every incident yet. After the first incident he worked on, he
wrote a very detailed postmortem about what happened.

A few weeks later, he told me "huh, other people have started regularly writing
postmortems for their incidents too! It looks like we have a culture of
regularly writing postmortems for incidents now!".

I thought this was really cool because it's an example of how doing something
yourself once or twice can make it way easier for people to do the same! It's
way easier to write a postmortem for an incident if you have an existing
template to work with that your coworker wrote last week.

### what to expect in interviews

A few years ago my awesome coworker Kiran and I were talking about how a lot of candidates don't know what to expect when interviewing at our company. We basically wanted to write down the same tips we'd give to a friend about how to prepare for the interview, except, well, just put them on the website and give them to everyone. There are a lot of basic things that aren't obvious like:

* Should I bring a computer?
* What should I wear?
* One of the interviews involves the basics of the HTTP protocol so it's important to be familiar with that!
* We expect people to code on their computer so it's useful to set up some common project boilerplate in advance
* We really like it when people bring questions to ask their interviewers!

I thought this was important because when I interviewed for jobs last, the
interviews and what kind of preparation people expected were often quite
different from company to company, and as a candidate (and especially as a
candidate who doesn't already have a friend there!) it can be unnecessarily
stressful.

So we wrote up a "what to expect when interviewing"
[document](https://stripe.com/jobs/engineering-onsite.pdf), someone else made
it into a pretty PDF, and we put it on the website! 

I just googled ("what to expect stripe") and found out that today we publish 6
different "what to expect" documents for different jobs, and that there have
been a lot of changes to the original document to improve it / keep it up to
date as our interview process has changed. So cool!!

### a more welcoming job description

A bunch of our job descriptions got revamped recently. One thing I sometimes
see in job descriptions is "you should have experience in
$EXACT_THING_YOU_WILL_BE_DOING". I always find that frustrating because, well
-- lots of the best people I konw didn't have any experience with the specific
technologies we work with before they started here (including me!) so why
should it be a requirement?

So I was like "I know! I will write a job description that I think is a
fair description of what we need!". I wrote a job description for the [job I have](https://stripe.com/jobs/positions/infrastructure-engineer). In
particular I added a new "Projects you could work on" section with specific
examples of projects so that people could see what they might actually work on.
And then I got the appropriate people to review it, we made some changes, and
it got posted! This was a pretty small thing but I think it is a good job
description.

And last week a manager on another team asked me for advice about how to make
their job description more clear about what the job is and sound more
inclusive and I told them what I thought!

For this one my manager at the time helped me a lot -- I said "hey, I want to
write a job description for our org", and he told me "awesome, here's who I you
need to talk to to get that done!" and gave me some useful advice. It didn't
matter that I'm not a manager or team lead or anything which I thought was
cool.

### better documentation

Until recently my team didn't have that much documentation for the infrastructure /
tooling we maintain. There were a lot of things that lots of people knew, and
that if you asked someone they would definitely explain to you, but just
weren't… written down anywhere. I made it one of my personal goals this quarter
to improve our documentation a lot. So I've written a bunch of documentation
myself, sometimes I'll pair with someone to document a system that needs
it, and other people have been writing new docs too. I'm excited about it and I
think it's easier for a new person to come in and start reading to learn how
our systems work than it was 6 months ago.

As an example of something that _didn't_ work that well: when I joined, I
wanted to make our documentation better, but I think I tried to make changes / ask people to make changes
kind of all over the place and it was too scattered. Doing it in a more focused
way ("I'm just going to document stuff on my team") has been a lot better.


### some changes are too big, though!

I spent some time last year advocating for us having concrete goals around
making the engineering team more diverse. We did end up setting some goals, but
I don't know whether I made a difference at all -- some things really do need
someone higher up to decide them. (I actually think the approach they came up
with is pretty cool, but it is not my thing to write about here)

So while there are lots of changes you can make by leading by example and from
the bottom up, this approach definitely doesn't work for everything.

### you can make changes, maybe

Not all of the changes I've tried have worked (and I've left out the things that
haven't worked :)), so this is a pretty optimistic view. But I really do
think that software engineers at tech companies sometimes have a bunch of
influence, and if I do the work to help make the change happen, sometimes
things can be a little bit different! I see a lot of other individual software
engineers making changes to make things on their teams a little better and I
think it's awesome. All companies are a work in progress and things cannot be
good unless we make them that way together :)

Some things that have helped me:

* Work on one thing at a time. I have a regular engineering job to do, so I only do one "side project" like this at once. So if I'm working on organizing an event, I'm not allowed to write a job description.
* Doing the work myself to start is easier than asking somebody else to change how they're doing something.
* Trying small changes first. Even if what I want is for all of our interviews to have standard evaluation guidelines (today that's true!!), I can't make that happen all at once, it's easier to say "ok, I'm just going to make some guidelines for myself to use".
* Work with other people!
* Remember my coworkers are probably on the same side as me :)
