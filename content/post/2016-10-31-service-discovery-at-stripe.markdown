I work at Stripe. I've been writing on this blog the whole time I've worked there
(going on 3 years), but today for the first time I published a blog
post on the Stripe blog. I'm happy with how it turned out. (it has an
adorable comic with servers gossiping about each other in it!)

I'm happy I work with so many people who will answer my questions and
explain things. I've learned a lot.
In particular [nelhage](https://twitter.com/nelhage) explained practically everything
in this post to me.

Here's the post: [Service discovery at Stripe](https://stripe.com/blog/service-discovery-at-stripe)
