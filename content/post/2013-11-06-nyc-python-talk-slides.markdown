I gave a talk at NYC Python today on how to use IPython Notebook, with
the 311 calls dataset from NYC Open Data as an example. We talked about
which borough complains the most about rats (the Bronx) and which days
of the week have the most noise complaints (Saturday, Sunday). 

It was a fun time! Here is the notebook, if you want to try it out
yourself: [bit.ly/nyc-python-pandas](http://bit.ly/nyc-python-pandas)
