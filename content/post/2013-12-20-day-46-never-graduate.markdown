Yesterday was the last day of Hacker School. This is a Sad Story.

I have a lot of feelings about this. Sad-to-be-leaving feelings and
can't-i-just-stay-forever feelings and i-get-to-live-at-home-again
feelings.

I will miss the people so much! However, I had the following
conversation with [Sumana](http://www.harihareswara.net/) about this.

* Julia: You have 4000 blog posts!
* Sumana: Well, they took 13 years to write!
* Julia: YEAH. I WILL WRITE 4000 BLOG POSTS TOO.
* Sumana: YEAH
* Julia: Oh, but what will I write about when Hacker School is over? I
  will have nothing to say!
* Sumana: Never graduate!

So hopefully I'll keep blogging and seeing all the friends I've made
here. And coding. And learning.
