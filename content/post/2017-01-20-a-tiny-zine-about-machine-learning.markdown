The other day I gave a talk on doing machine learning in production. It was a
short talk at a local meetup, and I felt like trying something new. Instead
of making slides, I wrote a short 8-page zine illustrating some concepts about
machine learning, printed 70 copies on my home printer (who has an awesome
long-arm swingline stapler? I DO!!!), and gave them out to everyone who came!

There are 2 versions of it, as usual:

* [a version you can read on your computer](/production-machine-learning.pdf)
* [a version you can print and staple and fold](/production-machine-learning-print.pdf)

If you like it, you should read the PDF that it's based on: [Rules of Machine Learning:
Best Practices for ML Engineering](http://martin.zinkevich.org/rules_of_ml/rules_of_ml.pdf), which I found out about thanks to [Avi Bryant](https://twitter.com/avibryant).

I learned that:

* giving a talk without using slides *at all* is possible. It was a little weird, but I will probably experiment with it again in the future. I still like using slides though!
* I can write a short, sketchy zine in 2 hours (which is the same amount of time it takes me to write similar-quality slides!)
* I can print, staple, and fold 70 zines in 40 minutes (with some folding help from my amazing partner Kamal :))
* giving away zines at a meetup is really fun, way more fun than being like "uh, the slides are on my website"
