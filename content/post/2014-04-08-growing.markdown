title: Becoming a better developer (it's not just writing more programs)
url: /blog/2014/04/08/growing/
---

I asked on Twitter today something I'd been talking to at lot of
friends about -- how does someone become a senior developer? How do I
know what I should be practicing? What qualities should I be looking
for in mentors?

The best answer I got was this blog post:
[On Being a Senior Engineer](http://www.kitchensoap.com/2012/10/25/on-being-a-senior-engineer/),
by [John Allspaw](http://www.kitchensoap.com/) at Etsy. I am mostly
writing this so I can remember go back and read that repeatedly. It
talks about

<!--more-->

* taking and seeking out criticism and
* non-technical skills and
* estimates (eeep! so hard!) and
* doing tedious and boring work and
* raising up the people around you ("generosity of spirit") and
* making tradeoffs explicit when making judgements and
* *empathy* and
* cognitive bias and
* so much more

But you should just go read it.

I've also been thinking about this tweet by [@seriouspony](http://twitter.com/seriouspony):

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>Myth: to get better at x, just do a lot more of it (writing/skating/coding, etc.) What/how you &quot;do&quot; X matters far more than how much/often.</p>&mdash; Seriouspony (@seriouspony) <a href="https://twitter.com/seriouspony/statuses/405010362384121856">November 25, 2013</a></blockquote>

and how it's easy to get stuck in a rut and keep doing the things
you're comfortable with. I'd like to not do that.
