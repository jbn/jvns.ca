title: 'Day 10: Goals. Goals? Maybe I need to be *reading* more code?'

Today I learned a bit of Clojure, and learned about a Julia plotting library
called [Gadfly.jl](https://github.com/dcjones/Gadfly.jl)
But it didn't feel super productive, and now I'm thinking a bit about
what my goals for Hacker School are. I think they're something like:

1. Contribute to open source projects! This is happening.
2. Write a non-trivial piece of software from scratch that I feel good
   about the design of. This is not happening at all. Still
   hunting for something which is the right size and which I can care
   about enough to do it.
3. Feel better about my ability to design good code. Also not happening
   yet.
4. Learn about concurrency, because I don't even.
5. Learn about how to write practical functional programs.

To address #3, I think I need to spend more time reading well-written
code. I'm still not sure about #2. Or #4. Or #5.

So far the things that have taught me the most were:

* doing a bit of async programming
* Learning about how Python bytecode works

Maybe writing a Javascript interpreter would be a fun way to address
numbers 2, 3, and 4?
