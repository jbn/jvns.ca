title: A few blogs I really like
url: /blog/2014/02/13/a-few-blogs-i-really-like/
---

I'm a bit hesitant about this list because I read many more blogs than
these that are really good. So if your blog is not here it is probably
mainly because my fingers got tired of typing. I may add more to this
later.

I'm trying to read more blogs about things I don't know much about
yet, to expandify my mind. So I spend some time reading Kelly Sommers
on distributed systems and Selena Deckelmann on Postgres and Sumana
Harihareswara on community management and Seth Godin on marketing and
Cathy O'Neil on finance and Raph Koster on game development.

* I just discovered that
  [Camille Fournier](http://whilefalse.blogspot.ca/) has a blog the
  other day and I started binge-reading it. She has a ton of systems
  programming experience, so she writes about that. But she's also the
  head of engineering at Rent the Runway, and she's writing amazing
  things about how the transition to management has been. I basically
  want to be her when I grow up. This post about
  [growing management mastery](http://whilefalse.blogspot.ca/2013/12/2013-constant-introspection-of.html)
  is amazing, and she has some pretty interesting
  [posts about ZooKeeper](http://whilefalse.blogspot.ca/2012/12/building-global-highly-available.html)
  which I don't totally understand yet but would like to.
* [Kelly Sommers](http://kellabyte.com/) aka
  [@kellabyte](https://twitter.com/kellabyte) writes and tweets about
  distributed systems and making code that's fast. I have almost no
  experience with this stuff, and I've learned a ton from just
  following her on Twitter. For example, her most recent blog post
  about
  [bad benchmarks and how to make good ones](http://kellabyte.com/2014/02/12/create-benchmarks-and-results-that-have-value/)
  is fantastic.
* The [Geek Feminism blog](http://geekfeminism.org/) has a great
  weekly roundup of links, and not-super-frequent posts about topic
  related to women in geekdom. I love this post by
  [Sumana Harihareshwara](http://www.harihareswara.net/) about
  [things women talk about at Hacker School](http://geekfeminism.org/2013/12/12/hacker-school-bechdel-test/).
* Speaking of [Sumana](http://www.harihareswara.net/)! She blogs about
  a whole bunch of delightful things, like open source communities and
  science fiction books. I learned a lot from her most recent blog
  post about
  [open source careers](http://www.harihareswara.net/sumana/2014/02/09/0).
* I really enjoy
  [programming in the twenty-first century](http://prog21.dadgum.com/).
  His most recent post on
  [how good coding practices can get in the way of actually getting work done](http://prog21.dadgum.com/190.html)
  is *excellent*.
* [Dan Luu](http://danluu.com/) writes delightful and thoughtful blog
posts.
[Why Don't Schools Teach Debugging](http://danluu.com/teach-debugging/)
is fantastic and closes with
> Why do we leave material out of classes and then fail students who
can’t figure out that material for themselves? Why do we make the
first couple years of an engineering major some kind of hazing ritual,
instead of simply teaching people what they need to know to be good
engineers? For all the high-level talk about how we need to plug the
leaks in our STEM education pipeline, not only are we not plugging the
holes, we’re proud of how fast the pipeline is leaking.
* Lindsey Kuper's blog [composition.al](http://composition.al/) is a
  great research blog. I don't understand everything, but I understand
  10x more about her research than I would if I *didn't* read her
  blog. I love her post
  [The LVar that wasn't](http://composition.al/blog/2013/12/24/the-lvar-that-wasnt/)
  where she introduces LVars and then talks about something that she
  thought was an LVar but wasn't. It's really engaging and I learned a
  new reason to care about lattices! If I ever do a PhD I will strive
  to do it like Lindsey.
* [Hilary Mason](http://www.hilarymason.com/) is a super cool data
  scientist, and I mostly wish that she blogged more frequently :)
  She's recently written a lot of great posts about public speaking,
  There's a great guest post on
  [how to spend time practicing your talk instead of messing with slides](http://www.hilarymason.com/speaking/speaking-spend-at-least-13-of-the-time-practicing-the-talk/).
  She also has wonderful data science posts about
  [how to find the optimal cheeseburger](http://www.hilarymason.com/presentations-2/in-search-of-the-optimal-cheeseburger/).
* [Philip Guo](http://pgbovine.net/) is an computer science researcher
  and super-nice guy. Right now he's writing mostly about his first
  year as a professor, and it's a fantastic insight into what his
  day-to-day life is like and how he organizes his work. My favorite
  post of his is without a question
  [Silent Technical Privilege](http://www.pgbovine.net/tech-privilege.htm).
  You should read it.
* [Raph Koster](http://www.raphkoster.com) has a game development
  blog. I don't actually care about game development at all, but a lot
  of his posts are relevant to many more people. His post on
  [self-promotion for game developers](http://www.raphkoster.com/2014/01/02/self-promotion-for-game-developers/)
  is truly fantastic, and not just for game developers.
* [Selena Deckelmann](http://www.chesnok.com/daily/) is a Postgres
  expert, and she's writing a great series about how she uses it every
  day. This is on my list of "things I read that don't really use
  right now but I am reading them just in case!"
* [Cathy O'Neil](http://mathbabe.org/) writes mostly about data
  science, math, and the American financial system. One of my favorite
  things that she's written is this essay
  [How to be a Data Skeptic (PDF)](http://cdn.oreillystatic.com/oreilly/radarreport/0636920032328/On_Being_a_Data_Skeptic.pdf).
* [Seth Godin's blog](http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/) isn't
  a technical blog at all, and I like it more than I expected to
  posts are daily, short, and give me something to think about often
  enough.
  [Exhaustive lists as a reliable tool for unstucking yourself](http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2014/02/exhaustive-lists-as-a-reliable-tool-for-unstucking-yourself.html)
  is particularly good.
* [Ta-Nehisi Coates](http://www.theatlantic.com/ta-nehisi-coates/) has
  an amazing blog for the Atlantic. Go read
  [To Europe -- Yes, but Together With Our Dead](http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2014/01/to-europe-yes-but-together-with-our-dead/283358/)
  and I think you will understand.
* Allison Kaptur has a cool series about the
  [Python interpreter](http://akaptur.github.io/), but she doesn't
  blog enough =(
