title: 'How I did Hacker School: ignoring things I understand and doing the impossible'

[Hacker School](https://www.hackerschool.com/) is a 12 week workshop
where you work on becoming a better programmer. But when you have 12
weeks of uninterrupted time to spend on whatever you want, what do you
actually do? I
[wrote down what I worked on every day of Hacker School](http://jvns.ca/blog/categories/hackerschool/),
but I always have trouble articulating advice about what to work on.
So this isn't advice, it's what I did.

<!--more-->

One huge part of the way I ended up approaching Hacker School was to
ignore a ton of stuff that goes on there. For example! I find all
these things kind of interesting:

* machine learning
* web development
* hardware projects
* games
* new programming languages

But I'd been working as a web developer / in machine learning for a
couple of years, and I wasn't scared by them. I don't feel right now
like learning more programming languages is going to make me a better
programmer.

And there were *tons* of interesting-sounding workshops where Mary
would live code a space invaders game in Javascript (!!!), or Zach
would give an intermediate Clojure workshop, or people would work
together on a fun hardware project. People were building neural
networks, which looked fun!

I mostly did not go to these workshops. It turned out that I was
interested in all those things, but more interested in learning:

* systems programming
  ([linkers](http://jvns.ca/blog/2013/12/10/day-40-learning-about-linkers/)!
  [strace](http://jvns.ca/blog/2014/04/20/debug-your-programs-like-theyre-closed-source/)!)
* networking
  ([ARP](http://jvns.ca/blog/2013/10/29/day-18-in-ur-connection/)!,
  [writing a TCP stack!](http://jvns.ca/blog/2013/11/27/day-34b-wrapping-up-the-tcp-stack/))
* how to write an operating system
  ([why is my operating system being erased?!](http://jvns.ca/blog/2013/12/16/day-43-hopefully-the-last-day-spent-fixing-linker-problems/))
* security (what actually is a buffer overflow?
  [how do I make one?](http://jvns.ca/blog/2013/10/28/day-17-buffer-overflows/))
* [how gzip works](http://jvns.ca/blog/2013/10/24/day-16-gzip-plus-poetry-equals-awesome/)
* how to write a
  [shell](http://jvns.ca/blog/2013/10/01/hacker-school-day-2-what-does-a-shell-even-do/)
* how floating point numbers work! Stefan Karpinski gave an amazing
  talk about this.

I wanted to work on things that seemed impossible to me, and writing an
operating system seemed impossible. I didn't know *anything* about
operating systems. This was amazing.

This meant sometimes saying no to requests to pair on things that
weren't on my roadmap, even if they seemed super interesting! I also
learned that if I wanted something to exist, I could *just make it*.

I ran a kernel development workshop for a while in my first two weeks.
[Jari](https://github.com/jtakkala) and
[Pierre](https://github.com/pyb) and
[Brian](https://github.com/briandignan) came, and they answered "what
is a kernel? what are its responsibilities?". This was hugely helpful
to me, and I learned a ton of the basics of kernel programming. Nobody
I talked to had built an operating system from scratch, so I learned
how! [Filippo](https://filippo.io/) answered a lot of my security
questions and helped when I was confused about assembly.
[Daphne](https://twitter.com/lifeissweetgood) was working on a shell
and I paired with her and learned a ton.

People at Hacker School know an *amazing* amount of stuff. There is so
much to learn from them.

So I don't have advice, but for me one some the most important things
to remember about Hacker School were that *other people have different
interests than me, and that's okay*, and *I can make Hacker School
what I want it to be*.
