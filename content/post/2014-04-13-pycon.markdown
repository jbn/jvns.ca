PyCon 2014 happened! It was my first time at PyCon, I expected to have
a good time, and it was better than I expected. I spoke! People came
up to me and said they enjoyed my talk! There were so many amazing
talks! I met so many people whose work I'd been following! 1/3 of the
talks were by women! It was *wonderful*.


A few talks that especially stood out to me, or that I missed and
*really* want to see. I didn't see anything like all the talks, but I
liked these. In no particular order:

Not all of the videos are up yet, but I'll come back to this later and
put in video links when they are.

* [Titus Brown](https://twitter.com/ctitusbrown) gave a wonderful talk
  about his work in computationally intensive biology. I found this
  particularly interesting because he offered roughly "I have harder
  data problems that your tech job does! Come do a PhD with me and
  I'll pay you a fraction as much." This was oddly compelling. Very
  much worth watching.
  [Notes from his talk](http://ivory.idyll.org/blog/2014-pycon.html),

* [Julie Pagano](https://twitter.com/juliepagano) gave
  [advice about battling imposter syndrome](https://us.pycon.org/2014/schedule/presentation/164/).
  I liked that her advice was practical! We need better advice than
  "you shouldn't have imposter syndrome!", and this did well at that.

* [Jessica McKellar](https://twitter.com/jessicamckellar)'s keynote on how we can help advance computer
  science education was amazing. It was amazing because she gave so
  many concrete suggestions and specific calls to action: there were
  easy things (for example: call your legislators and tell them CS
  should count for AP math/science credit!) and larger commitments.
  She challenged everyone to do just one thing in the upcoming year to
  try to make CS education in high school better.

* [Fernando Perez](https://twitter.com/fperez_org) spoke about the
  state of Python for scientific and how scientists are using IPython
  to easily make their work reproducible. I'm so impressed with the
  community he's building around this software. The tools are so good
  and getting better so quickly.

* [Naomi Ceder](https://twitter.com/NaomiCeder) spoke about
  [being a trans woman in the Python community](https://us.pycon.org/2014/schedule/presentation/182/).
  I saw so many positive comments about her talk on Twitter
  afterwards. I'm really interested to see what she has to say, and
  delighted that I work in a community where her perspective is
  valued.

* [Paul Tagliamonte](https://twitter.com/paultag)'s talk about
  [compiling Lisp to Python bytecode](https://us.pycon.org/2014/schedule/presentation/192/)
  was the kind of excited "let's see how far we can take this crazy
  idea!" talk that I really enjoy. Super enjoyable speaker.
  [[Video]](http://pyvideo.org/video/2616/getting-hy-on-python-how-to-implement-a-lisp-fro)
* [Julie Lavoie](https://twitter.com/hsjuju2) talked about
  [Analyzing Rap Lyrics with Python](https://us.pycon.org/2014/schedule/presentation/179/).
  I liked this because she clearly loves rap, and she gave some
  background on rap as an art form, including samples from different
  styles. Also it was a super fun introduction to natural language
  processing.
  [[Video]](http://pyvideo.org/video/2658/analyzing-rap-lyrics-with-python)
* [Tavish Armstrong](https://twitter.com/tavarm) talked about one of
  his favorite topics: how programmers can learn from software
  engineering research. His call to action: Try to measure something
  about your software engineering practice! Show it to your friends!
  Reproduce it! Give a talk at PyCon next year about it!
  [[Video]](http://pyvideo.org/video/2696/software-engineering-research-for-hackers-bridgi)
* [Allison Kaptur](https://twitter.com/akaptur) explained how
  [import works in Python, from the ground up](https://us.pycon.org/2014/schedule/presentation/229/).
  I loved that she started with a naive version of import and kept
  incrementally improving it until we got to a version that resembles
  how `import` actually works.
  [[Video]](http://pyvideo.org/video/2567/import-ant-decisions)
* I talked about why IPython Notebook and Pandas are my favorite tools
  for exploratory data analysis, and people said they enjoyed how
  enthusiastic I was afterwards. Yay!

A few more talks that I want to watch the videos for, but can't
comment on because, well, I haven't yet.

I never stop being impressed with people I meet at PyCon. Conferences
are so hard! I want to meet all the people and do all the things and
be in 3 places at things. And the sprints haven't even happened yet!

I'm so thankful to all the organizers for doing so much work to make
this possible. The conference chair
[Diana Clarke](https://twitter.com/diana_clarke) got a standing
ovation at the closing session, and more than deserved it.

♥ PyCon.
