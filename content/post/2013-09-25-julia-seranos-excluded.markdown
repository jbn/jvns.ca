Bought this book at [Bluestockings](http://bluestockings.com/) the other
day. It's subtitled "Making Feminist and Queer Movements more
inclusive". Pretty much the best $18 I've ever spent. It is *so good*.
She's reading at Bluestockings in October and I am so excited.

I'm less than halfway through so far, but I really like this:

> I refuse to believe in the myth that all women share a common bond. The
> truth is that we are all very different from one another. We each live
> with a different set of privileges and life experiences. And once we

This is so obvious ("all women are different, and do tons of different
things! And all of those things are okay!"), but so easy to forget. Also
you can replace 'women' with anything. I was really happy and surprised
not too long ago when I realized that everything I do is a "thing women
do" (and a "thing programmers do"), because I do them.

I love the idea of using labels as a way to talk about what we have in
common and bring us together, instead of boxes to limit ourselves with.

Some other things she talks about:

* "Being an ally is not something that comes naturally. It requires
  work"
* The way to make our communities more inclusive is not to make them
  more radical -- that's often just another way to exclude people in
  different ways, like people who are not "queer enough".
* How queer communities value masculinity over femininity, in men and in
  women. (and how that doesn't even make sense)
* How pretty much everyone seems to value masculinity over femininity.
