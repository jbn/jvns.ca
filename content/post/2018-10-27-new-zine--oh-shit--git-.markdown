Hello! Last week [Katie Sylor-Miller](https://twitter.com/ksylor) and I released a new zine called
"Oh shit, Git!". It has a bunch of common git mistakes and how to fix them! I learned a surprising
number of things by working on it (like what `HEAD@{2}` means, and that you can do
`my-branch-name@{2}` to see what a branch was previously pointing to, and more ways to use `git diff`)

You can get it for $10 at [Oh shit, git!](https://gum.co/oh-shit-git) or a swear-free version at [Dangit, git!](https://gum.co/dangit-git). Here's the cover and table of contents: (you can click on the table of contents to make it bigger).

### why this zine?

I've thought for a couple of years that it might be fun to write a git zine, but I had NO IDEA how
to do it. I was in this weird place with git where, even though I know that git is really confusing,
I felt like I'd forgotten what it was like to be confused/scared by Git. And I write most things
from a place of "I was super confused by this thing just recently, let me explain it!!".

But then!! I saw that Katie Sylor-Miller had made this really fun and popular website called [oh
shit, git!](https://ohshitgit.com/).  And I thought, that's super fun, and it seems like it could be
useful for folks to have as a paper reference! Maybe we could make a zine out of it! So I emailed
her and she agreed to work with me. And now here it is! :D

### what's new in the oh shit, git! zine?

The zine isn't the same as the website -- we decided we wanted to add some fundamental information
about how Git works (what's a commit?), because to really work with Git effectively you need to
understand at least a little bit about how commits and branches work! And some of the explanations
are improved. Probably about 50% of the material in the zine is from the comic and 50% is new.

### a couple of example pages

Here are a couple of example pages, to give you an idea of what's in the zine:

and a page on `git reflog`:

### that might be it for zines in 2018!

I'm not sure, but I don't think I'll write any more zines for a couple of months. So far there have
been 5 (!!!) this year -- perf, bite size linux, bite size command line, help! I have a manager!,
and this one!. I'm really happy with that number and very grateful to everyone who's supported them.
