title: 'How does SQLite work? Part 1: pages!'

This evening the fantastic [Kamal](https://twitter.com/kamalmarhubi)
and I sat down to learn a little more about databases than we did
before.

I wanted to hack on [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/), because I've
used it before, it requires no configuration or separate server
process, I'd been told that its source code is well-written and
approachable, and all the data is stored in one file. Perfect!

<!--more-->
To start out, I created a new database like this:

```sql
drop table if exists fun;
create table fun (
    id int PRIMARY KEY,
    word string
);
```

Just a primary key and a string! What could be simpler? I then wrote a
little Python script to put the contents of `/usr/share/dict/words` in
the database:

```python
import sqlite3
c = sqlite3.connect("./fun.sqlite")
with open('/usr/share/dict/words') as f:
    for i, word in enumerate(f):
        word = word.strip()
        word = unicode(word, 'latin1')
        c.execute("INSERT INTO fun VALUES (?, ?);", (i, word))
c.commit()
c.close()
```

Great! Now we have a 4MB database called `fun.sqlite` for
experimentation. My favorite first thing to do with binary files is to
`cat` them. That worked pretty well, but Kamal pointed out that of
course `hexdump` is a better way to look at binary files. The output
of `hexdump -C fun.sqlite` looks something like this:

```
|.............{.n|
|.a.R.D.4.%......|
|................|
|...y.n._.N.>.,.$|
|................|
|..............F.|
|..EAcevedo.E...D|
|Accra's.D...CAcc|
|ra.C..#BAccentur|
|e's.B...AAccentu|
|re.A..!@Acapulco|
|'s.@...?Acapulco|
|.?...>Acadia's.>|
|...=Aradia.=...<|
|Ac's.<...;Ac.;..|
|%:Abyssinian's.:|
|..!9Abyssinian.9|
|..#8Abyssinia's.|
|8...7Abyssinia.7|
```

I've pasted the first few thousand lines of the hexdump in
[this gist](https://gist.github.com/jvns/d21876d1388343c3a4a3), so you
can look more closely. You'll see that the file is alternately split
into words and gibberish -- there will be a sequence of mostly words,
and then unreadable nonsense.

Of course there's a rhyme to this reason! The wonderfully written
[File Format for SQLite Databases](https://www.sqlite.org/fileformat2.html)
tells us that a SQLite database is split into **pages**, and that
bytes 16 and 17 of our file are the **page size**.

My `fun.sqlite` starts like this:

```
00000000  53 51 4c 69 74 65 20 66  6f 72 6d 61 74 20 33 00  |SQLite format 3.|
00000010  04 00 01 01 00 40 20 20  00 00 00 27 00 00 0c be  |.....@  ...'....|
          ^^ ^^
        page size :)
```

so our page size is `0x0400` bytes, or 1024 bytes, or 1k. So this
database is split into a bunch of 1k chunks called pages.

There's an index on the `id` column of our `fun` table, which lets us
run queries like `select * from fun where id = 100` quickly. To be a
bit more precise: to find row 100, we don't need to read every page,
we can just read a few pages. I've always understood indexes in a
pretty vague way -- I know that they're "some kind of tree", which
lets you access data in O(log n), and in particular that databases use
something called a **btree**. I still do not really know what a btree
is. Let's see if we can do any better!

Here's where it starts to get really fun! I downloaded the sqlite
source code, and Kamal and I figured out how to get it to compile.
(using nix, which is a totally other story)

Then I put in a print statement so that it would tell me every time it
accesses a page. There's about 140,000 lines of SQLite source code,
which is a bit intimidating!


It's also incredibly well commented, though, and includes adorable
notes like this:

```c
/************** End of btree.c ***********************************************/

```

My next goal was to get SQLite to tell me how it was traversing the
pages. Some careful grepping of the 140,000 lines led us to this
function `btreePageFromDbPage`. All page reads need to go through this
function, so we can just add some logging to it :)

```c
/*
** Convert a DbPage obtained from the pager into a MemPage used by
** the btree layer.
*/
static MemPage *btreePageFromDbPage(DbPage *pDbPage, Pgno pgno, BtShared *pBt){
  MemPage *pPage = (MemPage*)sqlite3PagerGetExtra(pDbPage);
  pPage->aData = sqlite3PagerGetData(pDbPage);
  pPage->pDbPage = pDbPage;
  pPage->pBt = pBt;
  pPage->pgno = pgno;
  printf("Read a btree page, page number %d\n", pgno); // added by me!
  pPage->hdrOffset = pPage->pgno==1 ? 100 : 0;
  return pPage;
}
```

Now it'll notify us every time it reads a page! NEAT! Let's experiment
a little bit.

```
sqlite> select * from fun where id = 1;
Read a btree page, page number 1
Read a btree page, page number 5
Read a btree page, page number 828
Read a btree page, page number 10
Read a btree page, page number 2
Read a btree page, page number 76
Read a btree page, page number 6
1|A's

sqlite> select * from fun where id = 20;
Read a btree page, page number 1
Read a btree page, page number 5
Read a btree page, page number 828
Read a btree page, page number 10
Read a btree page, page number 2
Read a btree page, page number 76
Read a btree page, page number 6
20|Aaliyah
```

Those two rows (1 and 20) are in the same page, so it traverses the
same path to get to both of them!

```
sqlite> select * from fun where id = 200;
Read a btree page, page number 1
Read a btree page, page number 5
Read a btree page, page number 828
Read a btree page, page number 11
Read a btree page, page number 2
Read a btree page, page number 76
Read a btree page, page number 2818
200|Aggie
```

Apparently `200` is pretty close in the tree, but it needs to go to
page `2818` instead at the end. And `80000` is much further away:

```
sqlite> select * from fun where id = 80000;
Read a btree page, page number 1
Read a btree page, page number 5
Read a btree page, page number 1198
Read a btree page, page number 992
Read a btree page, page number 2
Read a btree page, page number 1813
Read a btree page, page number 449
80000|scarfs
```

If we go back and inspect the file, we can see that pages 1, 5, 1198,
992, 2, and 1813 are *interior nodes* -- they have no data in them,
just pointers to other pages. Pages 6, 2818, and 449 are *leaf nodes*,
and they're where the data is.

I'm still not super clear on how exactly the interior pages are
structured and how the pointers to their child pages work. It's time
to sleep now, but perhaps that will happen another day!

Modifying open source programs to print out debug information to
understand their internals better: SO FUN.
