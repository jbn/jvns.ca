title: Learning at open source sprints (no preparation required)
url: /blog/2015/04/12/learning-at-open-source-sprints/
---

I'm someone who isn't heavily involved in contributing code to OSS, and
normally go to sprints just to learn something new, and not with any
particular goals. This has never worked out that well for me, but I had
a new idea yesterday! Maybe if you're like me it will help you.

I was talking to someone yesterday about contributing to a relatively
complicated open source project during the sprints. And we worked out
that they were super super interested in learning about the project's
internals, and didn't necessarily need to contribute to the project!

Contributing to a project for the first time is hard. There's a lot
you need to know! And the area of the project you're interested in might
not necessarily need contributions right now! Or you might not be able
to make the contribution you're interested in on your first 3 days.

So we came up with an AWESOME IDEA. Instead of trying to write a
contribution, change the goals! The next time I go to a sprint, I think
I'll just 

1. pick a project I'm interested in
1. decide on a thing I'd like to learn about that project
1. start digging into the project, running code, and learn about that
   thing
1. not worry about contributing

For me, I think this could be way more fun and that I'd learn a lot
more. And it would be fun to do this stuff near the team who works on
the project, regardless of whether or not they have time to help me :)

And maybe, while exploring with no particular goal, I'd find a change
that needs making! :) Or if I wanted to contribute to the project 6
months down the road, I'd be a little more prepared to do that.
