title: CUSEC = fun

Last week I attended [CUSEC](http://2014.cusec.net/), an undergrad
conference for software engineers. They invited me to speak which was
super exciting, and there were a lot of great talks. I also got to
meet [Kelsey Gilmore-Innis](https://twitter.com/kelseyinnis) and it
was pretty great.

Some of my favorite things:
<!--more-->

* [Josh Matthews](http://www.joshmatthews.net/) gave a great
  introductory talk on how to contribute to Firefox. I liked how he
  gave some concrete examples of small patches. He also showed off
  [http://whatcanidoformozilla.org/](http://whatcanidoformozilla.org/),
  which I hadn't heard of before. You can see the
  [slides](http://www.joshmatthews.net/cusec14/) on his website, and
  they have tons of detail. He really made the Mozilla community sound
  friendly and welcoming and it was great.
* [Kelsey Gilmore-Innis](https://twitter.com/kelseyinnis) talked about
  how functional programming isn't scary and the reasons she liked it.
  I liked how she pushed back against the notion that functional
  programs are unreadable -- she pointed out that people who write
  imperative programs spend a lot of time learning how to read for
  loops, and learning how to read `map` is similar. Food for thought
  for sure.
* [Avi Bryant](https://twitter.com/avibryant) gave an
  easy-to-understand-for-me introduction to HyperLogLog and talked
  about how we can often write better programs if we write them
  probabilistically. Fun!

[Monica](http://twitter.com/notwaldorf),
[Kelsey](https://twitter.com/kelseyinnis), and a few other people put
together something we called CUSECLadies. Basically we invited all the
women students at CUSEC to meet up with us (women with programming
jobs and a few years' experience on them) and had a big group
discussion. We talked about salary negotiation, whether or not women
stay in tech, how we all got into programming, people's experiences in
school, whether we identify as feminists, advice for talking to
companies at job fairs, the role of women-only groups, and a whole
bunch of other things.

It was totally unplanned, but I think/hope people got something out of
it. 

I also gave a talk! It was called "You can be a kernel hacker!" and it
was 100% the most fun talk I have given so far. Here are
[links to the resources](http://bit.ly/kernelfun) I talked about.

A whole bunch of delightful people came up to me after and told me
that they now feel like they know what a kernel is and how to get
started with kernel programming! What a world =D

My favorite new talk tactic (thanks to
[Monica](http://twitter.com/notwaldorf)) is to gray out everything
irrelevant when showing code samples. Here's an example:

Before:

After:

<img src="/images/chmod-code-crossed-out.png">

I found that this really helped with the cognitive load of code
samples and made showing kernel code much less intimidating. The
technical term for this is "eraser eyes".
