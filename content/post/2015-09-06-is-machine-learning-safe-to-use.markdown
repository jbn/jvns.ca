I've been thinking about this a lot because I do ML at work. here are a few of my
current thoughts. I'd like to hear what you think 
[on twitter](https://twitter.com/b0rk/status/640536115091521536) -- I think  being responsible for the accuracy of a system that you don't fully understand is scary/ very interesting.

transcript:

**FIRST**: Can you understand your model? A regression with 10 variables is easy; a big random forest isn't. 

A model you don't understand is

* **awesome**. It can perform really well, and you can save time at first by ignoring the details.
* **scary**. It will make unpredictable and sometimes embarrassing mistakes. You're responsible for them.
* **only as good as your data**. Often when I train a new model I think at some point "NO PLZ DON'T USE THAT DATA TO MAKE DECISION OH NOOOOO"

Some way to make it less scary:

* have a human **double check** the scariest choices
* use complicated models when it's okay to make unpredictable mistakes, simple models when it's less okay
* use ML for research, learn why it's doing better, incorporate your findings into a less complex system
