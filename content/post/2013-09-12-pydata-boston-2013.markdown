I went to PyData Boston in July. The videos are just coming out now, so here are
a couple of things that I enjoyed.

[Travis Oliphant](http://technicaldiscovery.blogspot.ca/), the CEO of
Continuum Analytics & author of NumPy gave the opening keynote. It was a great
overview of what Continuum Analytics is up to (basically making wonderful
software like [Anaconda](https://store.continuum.io/) and
[Wakari](http://wakari.io) and a million other amazing-looking things.).

When talking about [Numba](http://numba.pydata.org/), he said "In my
mind, there's no reason to write C++ anymore" for scientific computing --
you can just use Numba and decorate your Python functions with `@autojit`.

Goodness.

[Lynn Cherny](http://www.ghostweather.com/bio.html) gave a great talk about
detecting sex scenes in Fifty Shades of Grey. She talks about using Mechanical
Turk to build a classifier. It's super interesting and hilarious. I'm really
happy that I know that she exists now. I also found out that she maintains a
mailing list for data visualization jobs. [Here's the video](http://vimeo.com/74075845).

She said that she does all her data analysis in Python, and then writes
frontends in Javascript (using D3).

[Jeff Bezanson](Jeff Bezanson) from the [Julia](http://julialang.org/) project
gave a short intro to Julia. What stood out to me the most was not how cool
Julia looks (though it does!) but he just seemed like such a lovely guy. He
said there's lots of work to be done on Julia, and now I really want to
contribute. Apparently most of the standard library for Julia is written in
Julia!  Also [Stefan Karpinski](http://karpinski.org/) is a Hacker School
resident and &lt;3 Hacker School. [Here's the video of his talk](http://vimeo.com/73317363).

In the lightning talks, [Robert Speer](http://web.media.mit.edu/~rspeer/)
demoed a neat library for fixing Unicode called
[ftfy](https://github.com/LuminosoInsight/python-ftfy).

I also met [Kat Chuang](http://katychuang.github.io/) who runs [PyLadies NYC](http://www.meetup.com/NYC-PyLadies/) and is great.
