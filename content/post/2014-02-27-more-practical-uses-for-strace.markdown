title: More practical uses for strace!

---

In yesterday's blog post on
[using strace to avoid reading Ruby code](http://jvns.ca/blog/2014/02/26/using-strace-to-avoid-reading-ruby-code/)
I asked the Internet for some more suggestions of practical uses for
strace.

There were so many excellent suggestions that I couldn't not share!

[Mike English](http://twitter.com/gazoombo) pointed me to this
*wonderful*
blog post  
[Tools for Debugging Running Ruby Processes](http://spin.atomicobject.com/2013/08/19/debug-ruby-processes/)
he wrote about using strace, lsof, and gdb to debug a running Ruby
processes. He remarks that some of the things are like open-heart
surgery -- you can go into a running Ruby process and execute code
using gdb, but you might kill the process. Super cool and definitely
worth a read.

Some more great suggestions of what to do with strace:

Look for the 'open' system call!

A suggestion to also use ltrace:

is that I usually start with strace, get annoyed with it, then
remember to use ltrace instead. :-)</p>&mdash; Brian Mastenbrook

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"
lang="en"><p><a href="https://twitter.com/b0rk">@b0rk</a> check out
syscall tracing on Linux, it&#39;s like strace for the whole system,
handy if you want to know which process is doing something.</p>&mdash;

didn't know syscall tracing was a thing! This seems very worthy of
investigation.

Here are some
[slides by Greg Price](http://price.mit.edu/tracing-w2014/#12) with a
bunch of great suggestions for fixing various problems, as well as his
blog post
[Strace - The Sysadmin's Microscope](https://blogs.oracle.com/ksplice/entry/strace_the_sysadmin_s_microscope)
from the wonderful ksplice blog.

Alex Clemmer wrote a super cool post on using dtruss (strace, but for
OS X/BSD) to try to better understand concurrency primitives:
