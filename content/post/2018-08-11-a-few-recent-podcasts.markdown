In the last few months I was on a few podcasts. Maybe you will like them!

* [Software Engineering Daily](https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2018/06/05/profilers-with-julia-evans/), talking about rbspy and how to use a profiler
* [FLOSS weekly](https://twit.tv/shows/floss-weekly/episodes/487), again about rbspy. They told me
  I'm the guest that asked *them* the most questions, which I took as a compliment :)
* [Hanselminutes with Scott Hanselman](https://hanselminutes.com/643/learning-how-to-be-a-wizard-programmer-with-julia-evans) on writing zines / teaching / learning
* [CodeNewbie](https://www.codenewbie.org/podcast/how-does-the-internet-work) on computer networking
  & how the Internet works (from March)

I find podcasts a little scary -- my main medium is blogging/writing, which lets me edit it out when
I say something in a confusing way. Can't do that as well on a podcast! They seem to have turned out
okay anyway, and I think practicing talking extemporaneously on a subject is useful :)

One surprising-to-me thing about podcasts was that podcasters all care a lot about what recording
equipment you use, which makes sense! It turns out that sound quality is important.

I had fun doing all of these -- podcasts are WAY easier to organize than talks (no travel!) and now
I have a fancy podcasting microphone. And that means I can record more things in the future if I
want. I have this dream of making fun animated videos but that probably won't happen any time soon.
