I just released a new zine! It's called "Help! I have a manager!"

This zine is everything I wish somebody had told me when I started out in my career and had no idea
how I was supposed to work with my manager. Basically I've learned along the way that even when I
have a _great_ manager, there are still a lot of things I can do to make sure that we work well
together, mostly around communicating clearly! So this zine is about how to do that.

You can get it for $10 at https://gum.co/manager-zine. There are also various company rates if you
want to buy it for your team. Here's the cover and table of contents:

### a couple of my favorite pages from the zine

I've been posting pages from the zine <a href="https://twitter.com/b0rk">on twitter</a> as I've been
working on it. Here are a couple that I think are especially useful -- some tips for what even to
talk about in 1:1s, and how to do better at asking for feedback.
