title: 'Day 4: Processes vs threads, and kernel modules!'

---

There was Linux Kernel Club again yesterday! We spent about half our
time having [Daphne](https://github.com/lifeissweetgood) explain the
difference between a process and a thread which clarified my brain a
bit. Here's what I understood:

Processes each have their own PID and *address space*, threads share the
PID and address space of a single process.

<!--more-->

What is *address space*?
------------------------

Each process has a piece of memory that it's allowed to use, so that
processes can't step on each others' toes.

This includes

* the *code* or *text* of the program
* the program's *data* (strings and constants)
* the *heap* (grows dynamically, where the memory allocated using `malloc` lives)
* the stack (a fixed size, where local variables and functions calls
  live. Relevant terms: *stack overflow*, *stack trace*)
* the environment variables
* the command line arguments

There also appear to be a bunch more things listed on
[this page on kernel.org](https://www.kernel.org/doc/gorman/html/understand/understand007.html).
I'm not sure what most of them mean, but see the list starting with 
``The meaning of each of the field in this sizable struct is as follows: ''.

Why threads?
------------

Good things:

* They can communicate more easily between each other, because they can
  just write to the same memory
* Don't need to make a copy of the address space for each new thread

Bad things:

* Because they write to the same memory, you can have all kinds of race
  conditions. So you need to use mutexes and things.


Kernel modules
--------------

We also talked about kernel modules. The consensus was that writing a
kernel module is a really good way to get started with Linux kernel
development, so I think I'm going to try to write one on Monday!

We talked a bit about exploits and rootkits and dastardly things that
kernel modules can do.
