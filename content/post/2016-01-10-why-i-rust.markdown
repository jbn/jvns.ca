title: Why I ‚ù§ Rust

I gave a talk about why I like Rust a while ago! There's no video. Normally my
talk slides are unremarkable and I don't post them, but I think these mostly stand on their own and I'm happy with how they turned out. [Here it is (and it's embedded below)](https://speakerdeck.com/jvns/why-i-rust).
