Wrote a really quick zine out of the linux tracing tools post from yesterday.
It's not super fancy but here it is. It's 12 pages, there's a print version & a
version to read on your computer as usual.

I'm experimenting with various methods of distribution. This one asks for you
email, and the idea is that if I update the zine with new awesome stuff, you'll
get an email. Also it's useful for me to get an idea of how many people are
reading it (like, is it worth me making these things? :)).
