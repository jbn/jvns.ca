HI FRIENDS. In December, I started writing a zine about computer
networking! In it, I explain everything that happens when you download
[this image](http://jvns.ca/cat.png) from the internet, in as much
detail as I can fit in 24 pages.

Have you been seeing cool drawings about networking concepts on Twitter
from me, and wondering "Julia, I really want to have all of these
in one place, how can I get that??"? This is what I was working on!

Here's the (amazing) cover, by rad programmer [Lee Baillie](https://twitter.com/_lbaillie).

This zine explains:

* how packets are put together
* all the steps to download a cat: DNS, sockets, TCP connections, HTTP,
  and TLS
* networking notation
* networking layers
* what even is a "port"
* and more!

I'm really excited about this -- I spent a really long time being
confused about how any of this networking stuff worked AT ALL, and I'm
hoping this zine will help some people understand a few more things. 

Also I am worried about what is happening in the world this week, and
I wanted to do a small thing to help.
