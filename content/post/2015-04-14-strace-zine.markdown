title: A zine about strace

**UPDATE**: this zine and more can now be found at [jvns.ca/zines](https://jvns.ca/zines)

As some of you might have heard, I wrote a zine to teach people about
how to debug their programs using strace a while ago! I was originally
going to mail it out to people, but it turns out I'm too lazy to mail
anything.

So instead, you can download, print, fold, and staple it yourself today!
It should work if you print it double-sided with short edge binding on
letter paper. Also if you print an initial master copy, you can take it
to a copy shop and get them to make many copies for you.

Give it to your friends/colleagues/students to teach them about strace!
Send me pictures! [Tell me](https://twitter.com/b0rk) what you think! <3

[Here's the pdf. Have fun.](http://jvns.ca/strace-zine-portrait.pdf) (there's also a [landscape version](http://jvns.ca/strace-zine-landscape.pdf))

You can also [read it on your computer](http://jvns.ca/strace-zine-unfolded.pdf). But printing it is better! =D
