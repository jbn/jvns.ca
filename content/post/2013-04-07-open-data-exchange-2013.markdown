title: Open Data Exchange 2013

I went to an amazing conference yesterday called [Open Data Exchange](http://odx13.com).

There were so many interesting, thoughtful people who are really
interested in how to make the best use of open data to make things
better. It was the best open data event I've ever been to.
Here's a few things that stood out to me. I've probably misrepresented
what all of these people were saying in one way or another, but
hopefully it is more or less accurate.

One point that came up again and again is that it's important to
*humanize* data and to *connect* programmers and designers and open data
advocates with citizens, business owners, and experts in their fields.
Open data apps are only useful if they're solving problems that people
are really having, and answering questions that people really need to
know the answers to.

### Lightning talks

* [Diane Mercier](http://dianemercier.com/) from the city talked about
  her work in educating people who work for the city on how to open up
  data. She's amazing and I'm so glad that there are people like her
  advocating for open data at the city.
* [Trina Chiasson](http://trina.ch/) talked about how important it is to
  *humanize* data, using the example of the piles of documents
  collected during the Guatemalan civil war. This really made me think
  about how to make sure that things I work on are actually useful to
  people, and not just fun to work on.
* [Anton Dubrau](http://cat-bus.com) demoed an app he made that
  [overlays 1947 aerial photos with 2011 satellite views](http://www.app.catbus.ca/1947satelliteview/app.html). His was
  the only talk to get spontaneous applause. It's definitely worth
  checking out his [blog on maps and public transit](http://cat-bus.com/).
* [Alex Aylett](http://www.openalex.ca/) from [Eco Hack MTL](http://www.ecohackmtl.org/) 
  talked about urban sustainability projects. He's interested in how open
  data can apply to organizations like [Santropol Roulant](http://santropolroulant.org/site/) and
  [Alternatives](http://www.alternatives.ca/en). He said that his main
  goal with Eco Hack MTL was not to work on any specific project, but to
  connect people from different areas and get them to talk to each
  other. Fantastic. There's going to be a 5 à 7 in May and I'm
  definitely going to be there.
* [Roberto Rocha](http://blogs.montrealgazette.com/author/robertogaz/),
  a data journalist at the Gazette, talked about how programmers can
  collaborate with journalists. In particular, he said that journalists
    * can help ask the right questions to put together a story
    * have an audience :)
    * know more about how to talk to politicians and organizations to
      get information, including how to make access to information
      requests
* [Edward Ocampo-Gooding](http://edwardog.net/) from [Open Data Ottawa](http://blog.opendataottawa.ca/)
  introduced the idea of [speed idea dating](http://www.quora.com/Shopify/We%E2%80%99re-planning-on-throwing-our-first-hack-a-thon-this-year-What-are-the-pros-cons-and-how-can-we-get-the-most-out-of-sponsoring-them). 
  I'm definitely going to try this when I next organize a hackathon-type
  event. They also organized a meeting where programmers got to talk to
  the local politicians who were providing the open data. So impressed
  with what they're doing and how open the local government in Ottawa is
  to these initiatives.

### Panels

[Pete Forde](http://peteforde.com/) mentioned this blog
post by David Eaves, about how [open data saved Canada billions of dollars](http://eaves.ca/2010/04/14/case-study-open-data-and-the-public-purse/).

People often talk about the potential open data has to uncover
corruption, and it's really great to see concrete examples of that.

[Josée Plamondon](http://joseeplamondon.com/) who works on
[ContratsNet](http://contratsnet.wordpress.com/) spoke about how she
gets citizens, business owners, and experts involved. She said she had a
really valuable conversation about the issues with contracts in Montréal
with someone who owns a small construction company who explained what
they find frustrating. She's found that it's really difficult to engage
people online, and if you have meetings in real life you can learn a lot
more. Technology is less important than asking the right questions


[Corey Chivers](http://bayesianbiologist.com/) talked about work he's
doing to find out how the results people are reporting in ecology papers
are changing over the years.
([slides](https://speakerdeck.com/cjbayesian/future-avenues-for-open-data))

One of my absolute favorite things was [Tracey Lauriault](http://datalibre.ca/)'s 
talk on "Geospatial Data Infrastructures" -- how geospatial data is
being organized, and how we can learn from that. A couple of notes I
took during her talk:

* Groups like the [Group on Earth Observations](http://www.earthobservations.org/about_geo.shtml) have
  huge amounts of data and have been thinking about how to manage it for
  a long time. We can learn from them.
* Geographers have always had to share data, because mountains don't
  respect country boundaries. They've been doing this for decades.
* policy organizations don't always look at data analysis, data analysis
  people don't always think about policy
